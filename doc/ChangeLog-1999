 /* $Id: ChangeLog-1999,v 1.1 2000-07-09 22:27:49 phaller Exp $ */

 1999-12-31: Przemyslaw Dobrowolski <dobrawka@asua.org.pl>
	- WINMM: Implemented waveOutGet/SetVolume
	- KERNEL32: Fixed bugs in iccio.asm (OFFSET FLAT:devname)

 1999-12-31: Edgar Buerkle <Edgar.Buerkle@gmx.net>
	- KERNEL32: Started with implementation of debug apis & support
                    for debugging win32 apps (mostly for additional logging)

 1999-12-30: Christoph Bratschi <cbratschi@datacomm.ch>
	- USER32: ported menu control from WINE (not yet activated)
		  ported icontitle control from WINE
		  added winswitch control (stub)

                    (ordinals 35,36 & 37)
                    Added support for SEC_COMMIT memory map flag
                    Don't fail for unknown handles in (Msg)WaitForMultipleObject;
                    they could be thread or process handles (which we don't translate)
	- USER32:   Load bitmaps file completely in LoadBitmapA. Creating
                    a file mapping with reserved memory has little use
                    as the entire file will be read completely anyway.
                    Added some useful logging for DDE apis.
                    Fixed problem with combo boxes refusing to expand if it
                    the edit control doesn't have the focus.
	- GDI32:    Fixed GetObject for DIB sections
	- COMCTL32: Increased default height of rebar band from 20 to 36
                    (temporary hack for AbiWord)

 1999-12-30: Bart van Leeuwen <Bart_van_Leeuwen@netage.nl>

 1999-12-29: Christoph Bratschi <cbratschi@datacomm.ch>
	- USER32: rewrote coordinate mapping (map*) and fixed some 1 pixel bugs
		  pro memoria:
		    point:     newY   = windowH-1-oldY
		    rectangle: newTop = windowH-oldTop
		  fixed some wrong window handles
		  Win32BaseWindow: added getClientHeight/Width,
		  getWindowHeight returns now the window height

 1999-12-29: Patrick Haller <phaller@gmx.net>
	- INCLUDE: ODINWRAP: new macros to save FS register for callback registration

                 NOTE: You must include os2mewrap.h instead of os2me.h
	- USER32: Fixed PostThreadMessage (RealPlayer G2 install almost works)
                  Fixed memory leak in PostMessage (structures of posted messages 
                  that aren't dispatched were never freed)
                  (InterVideo WinDVD 2.0 install almost works; tries to overwrite
                   msvcrt.dll (which fails as the install program uses that dll))
                  Fixed version resource (based on NT 4 SP3)
	- KERNEL32: Removed logging from icon & cursor (group) conversion
                    (compile with DEBUGALL=1 to enable it)
                    Added version resource (based on NT 4 SP3)
	- GDI32: Added version resource (based on NT 4 SP3)
	- MSVCRT/20/40: Added version information based on NT 4 SP3 msvcrt dlls

 1999-12-28: Vit Timchishin <tvv@sbs.kiev.ua>
	- USER32: Listbox fix; Commented out 'if (index == oldsel) return LB_OKAY;'
                  in LISTBOX_SetSelection as this may prevent the control from
                  sending a notification after a change with notify disabled.
                  (i.e. MoveCarret)

 1999-12-28: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
	- WININET: Created stub dll

                    for desktop system)
	- SHELL32: Implemented PathBuildRootW, PathRemoveBackslashW, PathFileExistsW,
                   StrChrA & StrRChrW

          mpr, msvcrt(20/40), msvfw32, olecli32, oledlg, olesvr32, psapi,
          rasapi32, version:
                    Added commented-out exports and changed ordinals to match 
                    with the dlls from Windows NT 4.0 ServicePack 6 or Windows 
                    98SE
          NOTE: Requires recompile of all Odin dlls & any Odin32 apps.

	- KERNEL32: Enable write access for code sections which have this flag
                    set in the PE image (fixes crash in WinDVD)

	- USER32: Fixed bug in OSLibWinQueryQueueStatus (uninitialized local variable)
	          Changed message handling. Messages are translated in Get/PeekMessage
                  now. (or in the PM window handler, if it was sent directly)
                  TranslateMessage now translates WM_(SYS)KEYDOWN/UP to

                 more colorconversion code:
                  8bit to all hicolormodes(16,24,32) and 
                  between the highcolormodes
                 Do Colorfills for the above modes. 
                 Removed inhertiance from IBASE in DDRectangle

	- NTDLL/CRTDLL: Moved all CRT functions into CRTDLL
                        CRTDLL should contain all shared RTL functions (in addition
                        to those present in the win32 version); this is more
                        consistent than putting half the rtl functions in NTDLL
                        and the rest in CRTDLL.
	- CRTDLL: Fixed memory allocation bug (CRTDLL_calloc called calloc, while
                  free calls HeapFree; everything uses private CRTDLL heap now)
	- MSVCRT: Removed all forwarders from def file. Link with CRTDLL instead.
                  NOTE: Non-existant forwarders don't generate errors when loading
                        this dll!!!
                        Linking with a lib makes sure the import really exists.
	- KERNEL32: Moved memmove to NTDLL (forwarded to CRTDLL)
	- ODINCRT: Added wrappers for file io functions (to prevent FS corruption)

 1999-12-20: Rene Pronk <R.Pronk@twi.tudelft.nl>
	- WINMM: Bugfixes in waveOutOpen (flags) for winamp

 1999-12-20  Markus Montkowski <mmontkowski@gmx.de>

	- USER32: changed icon title font size in SystemParametersInfo to 12
		  fixed DrawIcon/DrawIconEx
		  fixed GetIconInfo (still bugs in load/create code)

 1999-12-20: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
	- CRTDLL: Added bsearch from EMX
	- MSVCRT: Copy dlls into bin directory. Most apps seem to work
                  (Notes, solitaire, winhlp32)
	- NTDLL: Added qsort, ftol, CIpow, ltoa, ultoa
                 (ftol fixes black Notes toolbars)

 1999-12-20: Jens Wiessner <wiessnej@rfi.de>
	- MSVCRT: Added stubs

 1999-12-19: Christoph Bratschi <cbratschi@datacomm.ch>
	- USER32: fixed child positioning
		  removed CS_SIZEREDRAW, do it manually if window really needs it
		   handled in WM_CALCVALIDRECTS, PM aligns windows top-left
		   -> much faster, Calc: radiobuttons are at the right place
		      RegEdit: treeview redraw problems fixed

 1999-12-19: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
	- ADVAPI32/NTDLL: Forward sid apis to ntdll (need to check return
                          type of some Rtl SID apis (bool or status dword?))
                          Moved Service apis into separate sourcefile
                          Implemented some service apis (not completely)
	- KERNEL32: Fix for loading images (RSRC_LOAD)
                    Implemented FindResourceExA/W
                    CreateProcessW bugfix (string conversion)
		    FormatMessageA/W bugfix (wrong calling convention for 
                    WVSPRINTFAPROC type (should be WIN32API!) -> fixes crash
                    in regedit
	- USER32: SendMessageW bugfix

                  SetMenuItemInfoA bugfix (for novamatic) (still not completely
                  implemented though)
	- AVIFIL32: updated with the latest code from Wine 991212.
	- KERNEL32: Partly implemented GetCurrencyFormatA/W (not correct, but 
                    to make apps happy)
                    Added handlemanager class for tokens and HMHandleGetUserData
                    export to query the userdata dword of a handle.

 1999-12-14: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
	- USER32: Tasklist fix
                  Rewrote SendMessage handling; Uses WinSendMsg now if window
                  is created by a different process/thread.
                  Started with port of Wine hook code
                  ShowWindowAsync calls ShowWindow now (not correct, but better than nothing)
	- KERNEL32: Added GetTHDBFromThreadId (used in USER32) & link THDB structures during creation

        - INCLUDE\WIN\winnt.h: Header fixes
	- Porting.txt: Fixed sample makefile (you need to add -D__i386__ as compiler option)
	- USER32:   NotifyParent bugfix (use id & handle of 1st child window)

	- KERNEL32: Fixes for on-demand page loader; currently disabled by
                    default because it interferes with debugging (too many
                    exceptions are generated)
                    To enable it undefine COMMIT_ALL in kernel32\winimagepeldr.cpp.
                    Dll unload fix for PE loader (fixes crash when Notes quits)
	- PE2LX:    Don't link with odincrt -> 'Not enough storage to complete

	  //To use private dll logging, define PRIVATE_LOGGING and
	  //add Open/ClosePrivateLogFiles (see below) functions to the dll
	  //to open close the private logfile. The logfile handle should
	  //be stored in the _privateLogFile variable
	  //dprintf can be called like this:
	  //dprintf((LOG, "PE file           : %s", szFileName));

                    trying to open existing mapping
                    commitPage: Commit page by page, not entire range (could

                    key and necessary subkeys (including CSD version)
                    Corrected return value of Read/WriteFile (must be boolean, not 
                    an error code)
	- USER32: Major changes for window procedures
                  Now identical to Wine. Window is unicode only if it's
                  window procedure comes from a unicode class.
                  Add thunk code for procedures to store type.

                  Disabled CS_OWNDC support for now -> otherwise certain
                  windows never receive a WM_ERASEBKGND message. (memory SDK sample)
                  Fix for Abiword & memory.exe -> extra check for owndc in Begin/EndPaint

 1999-12-06: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>

 1999-11-03: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
	- COMDLG32: Import from shlwapi as the original Wine code does
	- SHELLL32: Added exports
	- SHLWAPI:  Link with shell32.lib for forwarders + added exports
	- USER32:   Fixed mouseactivate for subclassed OS/2 windows (scrollbars)
		    Fixed CreateIconIndirect (Wine file dialog now shows button
		    icons correctly)
		    Don't clear WS_CLIPSIBLINGS bit in OSSetWindowStyle.
		    Removed fix in PMFRAME WM_ADJUSTWINDOWPOS: Previous fix breaks
		    a lot of apps (button.exe/style.exe/header4.exe)
		    (fix = call default frame handler when receiving this msg
		     when the window hasn't been 'created' yet)

 1999-11-03: Christoph Bratschi <cbratschi@datacomm.ch>
	- USER32: fixed modal dialogs
		  added WM_CONTEXTMENU
	- COMCTL32: implemented statusbar size grip

		 the primary surface. => Map Editor of Red Alert works.

 00-11-02: Achim Hasenmueller <achimha@innotek.de>
	- COMCTL32: Incorporated latest WINE 991031 updates
	  Note: listview doesn't paint properly now. Will be fixed later.

 1999-11-02: Markus Montkowski <mmontkowski@gmx.de>

	- INCLUDE\odinwrap.h:
		  fixed wrong define (_ODINWARP instead of _ODINWRAP)
		  Only check the heap for consistency when DEBUG_ODINHEAP is
		  defined.
	- USER32: Uncommented EDIT_NOTIFY_PARENT call in EDIT_WM_SetFocus
		  (yesterday's showwindow fix makes sure no WM_SETFOCUS msgs
		   arrive before the dialog received it's WM_INITDIALOG msg)
		  Fixed more FS corruption in dc.cpp.
	- SHELL32: Added extra exports for comdlg32
	- COMDLG32: Ported Wine file & find common dialogs (991031)
		    Find & Replace dialogs enabled, Wine code called for

		    NOTE: Disabled for now. Comctl32 isn't stable enough
			  for the Win95 style Wine comdlg dialogs.
		    Fixed check for find/replace dialog. Notepad uses 32 byte
		    buffer, so why does the wine code fail for < 80 bytes?
		    Fixed display of find/replace dialog -> if not hooked
		    show dialog!
	- makefiles: Added debugsmp/nodebuginfosmp/releasesmp options to
		     start two nmake process to build everything on two cpus.

	- USER32: Delete all process windows & classes in exitlist handler
		  Set hwndInsertBehind to HWND_BOTTOM for group boxes
		  (fixes problems when groupbox control is defined after
		   controls inside it in dialog template)
		  Mouse activate fix.
		  Don't activate child windows in ShowWindow.
	- WINMM: Return failure for waveOutGetDevCapsA/W when there's no
		 audio hardware present.


 1999-11-01: Daniela Engert <dani@ngrt.de>
	- USER32: add WS_CLIPSIBLINGS to not-WS_GROUP style STATIC controls
		  (fixes missing text in WELCOME)

	!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

	This is a hack!

	Dialog controls which contain/surround other controls *need* to be
	created with the WS_CLIPSIBLINGS style.

	!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

 1999-10-31: Christoph Bratschi <cbratschi@datacomm.ch>
	- KERNEL32: Ported Wine time apis

		  Put back methods that belong in the Win32Dialog class.
		  (MapDialogRect, DIALOG_Init, several x & y unit helpers)
		  -> fixes calc window controls.

 1999-10-30: Christoph Bratschi <cbratschi@datacomm.ch>
	- USER32: added button control text justification
		  GetNextDlgTabItem/GetNextDlgGroupItem must work with all windows
		  -> radiobuttons
		  fixed scrollbar timer handling
		  pmframe: fixed WM_ACTIVATE bug

 1999-10-29  Markus Montkowski <mmontkowski@gmx.de>
	- GDI32:  Fixed bug in CreateDIBSection, only copy ptr when ptr. var not
		  NULL.
		  Added DIBSections to GetObject_A, so programms can query
		  a DIBSECTION for the obj.

 1999-10-30: Daniela Engert <dani@ngrt.de>

		  ModifyMenuW/InsertMenuW fixes.
		  Call CallWindowProcA/W in Send(Internal)MessageA/W
		  (in preparation of Wine unicode msg translation port)
		  Always call default window handler for WM_PAINT. Apparently
		  there are apps that return 0, but don't call BeginPaint.
		  Added extra messages for msg translation.

 1999-10-28: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
	- ADVAPI32: Fixed dprintf bugs in OpenSCManagerA/W (%s instead of %d)

 1999-10-27: knut st. osmundsen <knut.stange.osmundsen@pmsc.no>
	- WIN32K: It's working! At least on my testmachine running
		  the WSeB astrict UNI kernel and the Warp 4 astrict kernel.

 1999-10-27: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
	- KERNEL32: If dll can't be found, look in directory of kernel32 (PE loader)
		    Fixed iLoadLibrary (added .dll if it couldn't find this string in
		    the module name; now only does that if it can't find a '.')
		    Implemented WinExec using CreateProcessA.
		    Fixed file mapping view lookup bug. Views are now again stored
		    in per-process data segment.
		    Delete process memory maps in exitlist too.
	- KERNEL32: Fixed bug in icon conversion (rgb only for <= 8bpp)
		    Added support for color cursors (needs more testing but seems to work)

 1999-10-26: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
	- USER32: Fixed bugs in menu apis (Append/InsertMenuA/W)
		  Fixed InsertMenuItemA/W.
		  Finished up Patrick's work -> regedit menus now correct
		  In winmenu call only ODIN_* menu apis; decreases amount of
		  logging and increases speed.

	- KERNEL32: Removed menu resource + non-used resource methods
		    Fixed FS selector corruption in GetLocaleInfoA/W (use
		    ODINFUNCTION wrapper as it calls a OS/2 unicode api that has no
		    FS wrapper)

	- PELDR:  Increased stack from 192k to 640k (Quake 2 ran out of stack)
	- DSOUND/DDRAW: Fixed FS selector corruption in logging procedures
	  ---> Quake 2 works again (Yeah! :) )
	  NOTE: Quake 2 3.20 only starts the first time. Seems to change something
		in the config.cfg file that crashes it the next time you run it.
		(workaround: save original config.sys and restore it afterwards)

 1999-10-26: Patrick Haller <phaller@gmx.net>
	- USER32: Add: Ported Wine menu(ex) parser and integrated it into menu code
	- WINMM:  Fix: invalid callback check in dwaveout.cpp (Q2 makes noise again)

 1999-10-25: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
	- USER32: Removed SetFocus call in Edit control (WM_LBUTTONDOWN)
		  Virtual key translation table change (VK_RETURN (PM) -> 0x0A
		  VK_ENTER (PM_ -> 0x0A (VK_RETURN))
		  (fixes problems in edit control, but might not be a good fix)
		  Never call default window handler (PM) after WM_CHAR ->
		  PM sends the WM_CHAR to the owner window -> focus changes
		  in notepad.
	- USER32: (menus)
		  Rewrote LoadMenuIndirectA/W to use OS/2 apis
		  Implemented GetMenuInfo & SetMenuInfo (just store new info; nothing else done)
		  Implemented GetMenuContextHelpId/SetMenuContextHelpId
		  (based on Wine build 990815)
		  Partially implemented GetMenuItemInfo.
		  NOTE: Needs a complete rewrite.

	- INCLUDE\win\commctrl.h:

	- USER32: MDI window fixes (mdi children correctly activated; menus inserted)
		  Bugfix in WM_GETTEXT of Edit control (wrong string length)

		  Create system classes only every first time user32 is loaded
		  and only unregister them when the last win32 app quits.
		  Converted all OS/2 bitmaps to windows format and put them in user32.rc
		  (deleted all bmp files)
	- USER32,
	  COMCTL32,
	  SHELL32: Don't check if control atom already exists, always register
		   control.
	     NOTE: Global classes have a global atom, but the class objects
		   are NOT shared! (so you must recreate them for every app)

	- KERNEL32: Implemented shared memory mapped files (SDK memory sample
		    works for shared memory; haven't tested files and it requires
		    more testing!)
		    Added shared heap code for memory mapped objects

	- KERNEL32: Write logfiles to directory of kernel32 if executable is on
		    readonly device.
		    Fixed CreateProcess.
		    Added support for GetVersionSize/GetVersionStruct for images
		    that aren't loaded. (LX or PE; PE not tested!)

		 there's no soundcard (driver) in OS/2)
		 Disabled logging of timeGetTime
	- KERNEL32: Disabled logging for _lread (calls ReadFile which does it's own logging)
		    Return XCPT_CONTINUE_SEARCH for unhandled exceptions if
		    an OS/2 app uses the Odin32 api. (instead of killing the app)

	- COMCTL32: Fixed tab width bug. (GetTextExtentPoint32A used for unicode strings)
		    Use Wine resource compiled with wrc. Removed all Native* resource loading.
		    Added version resource.

	- USER32: Fixed corruption of OS/2 exception chain in dc.cpp & caret.cpp

		   on the Find tab in winhlp32's Search dialog)
		  Do not send WM_COMMAND messages to the window handler before
		  it has receive it's WM_CREATE msg.
		  Winhlp32 crashes when that's done before WM_INITDIALOG, but
		  VPBuddy no longer responds to buttons when you refuse to
		  send messages before WM_INITDIALOG. (TODO)
		  Send WM_WINDOWPOSCHANGING/CHANGED messages from frame handler.

		  Rewrote MapWindowPoints. (NOTE: Needs to be tested!)
		  Combobox bugfix (resizing listbox using old rectangle -> get current
		  one)

 1999-10-20: Patrick Haller <phaller@gmx.net>

	- USER32: Don't process size messages before sending WM_NCCREATE
		  message when creating a window. (can mess up our window
		  and client rectangle)
		  Erase background for buttons. (fixes groupbox redraw problems)
		  isFrameWindow bugfix + MDI creation & WM_NCCALCSIZE bugfix

 1999-10-15: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
	- USER32: CBT Hook bugfix. Only respond to WM_NCCREATE msg to send
		  HCBT_CREATEWND.
		  Scrollbar bugfix. Pass all msgs we don't use to default
		  window handler. (used to do this only for > WM_USER -->

		  Fixed window & child destruction process.
	- KERNEL32: Fixed VirtualQuery bug.

 1999-10-15: Edgar Buerkle <Edgar.Buerkle@gmx.net>

		  Removed FillRect during WM_PAINT in subclassed frame handler.
		  (still some redraw problems with i.e. button.exe; a little
		   worse than before)

	- ADVAPI32:	Fix: RegConnectRegistryA slightly improved

 1999-10-14: knut st. osmundsen <knut.stange.osmundsen@pmsc.no>
	- PE2LX:    New implementation in src\win32k\pe2lx.
		    No resource conversion. I have tested it, but do expect to
		    find some bugs. And when you find, please give me a hint.
		    The new Pe2Lx uses much support code,(heap, printf..)
		    from win32k. It also uses the sub-system CRT library (as
		    win32k does). This way more of the win32k code will be
		    tested in Ring 3, so there'll simply be less bugs to track
		    down in Ring 0 and kernel debugger/ICAT.
	- KERNEL32: Win32???Pe2Lx classes is updated to match the new Pe2lX.
		    Note that TLS is not implemented yet - it's in the line.
		    Fix: Made a temporary fix in atom.cpp for some of the W
		    functions. The string isn't allways a string... I do a
		    permanent fix some other day.
	- WIN32K:   Compiles and links. But Not Tested!

 1999-10-14: Edgar Buerkle <Edgar.Buerkle@gmx.net>

		  (add border size to size during window creation & SetWindowPos)
		  Support for WM_NCCALCSIZE. Not completely working yet.
		  Fixed crash in Winhlp32 (annotate creates multiline edit
		  control that received PM messages too early -> divide by 0)
		  -> Don't allow WM_WINDOWPOSCHANGED messages until after WM_NCCREATE.
		  Removed previous OSLibMapWINDOWPOStoSWP bugfix.
		  Default dialog xBaseUnit = 10, yBaseUnit = 20.

	- WINMM: Changed WinPostMsg calls into PostMessageA as win32 window
		 handles are not the same as PM handles anymore.
	- USER32: Adding desktop window class. When user32 is loaded, a desktop
		  window object is created.
		  GetDesktopWindow returns handle of this window.
		  Winhlp32 no longer crashes immediately, but briefly shows
		  it's window before quitting.
		  Create windows always with HWND_TOP. The if statement (hwndLinkAfter)
		  in the CreateWindowExA method of Win32BaseWindow class messes
		  up the Z-order of dialog controls (i.e. buttons in a group box)

	- WNASPI32: full implementation via ASPIROUT$ device driver.

 1999-09-19: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
	- USER32: Increased font pointsize for dialog (multiplied by two)
		  (probably not the right way to do things, but it works for the
		   dialogs in Solitaire)
		  Activated MsgEraseBackground method again (pmwindow.cpp)
		  Dialogs don't receive those otherwise.
		  (may need to be changed back again)

		    OSLIBWIN.H: the definitions of OSLIB_HWND_DESKTOP and
		    OSLIB_HWND_OBJECT were 1 off (with respect to the definition
		    in PMWIN.H)! So OSLIB_HWND_DESKTOP was in effect NULLHANDLE,
		    and OSLIB_HWND_OBJECT was HWND_DESKTOP.
