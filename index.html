<h3>Welcome</h3>
<p>
Odin is the name of the project and software<br>
that allows users to run Win32 applications OS/2.<br>
Conceptually, Odin is to OS/2 what Wine is to Linux.<br>
</p>

<h3>Special Information About This Clone</h3>
<p>
As you can see below, this clone maps to a special branch at Netlabs.<br>
The reason for this is that this special branch is meant to extend Odin<br>
with functionality to enable porting the <a href="https://www.eclipse.org/swt">Eclipse Standard Widget Toolkit</a><br>
to OS2, for which the projects will emerge <a href="http://rdpe.github.io">here</a>.<br>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>
The porting of SWT is done by mapping<br>
the Eclipse SWT-Win32 variant to the Odin32 sub-system.<br>
This is the same method as was used to port <a href="http://trac.netlabs.org/java">Java6 JRE and JDK</a> to OS/2.<br>
Such ports are called *Odin Based* and are native OS/2 applications.<br>
</p>

<h3>A Little History</h3>
<p>
AirBoot was initially designed and developed by Martin Kiewitz,<br>
back at the time when LBA addressing was just becoming mainstream.<br>
Over time, Martin continued to add features and fix reported problems,<br>
which resulted in a stable and mature product.<br>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>
When huge harddisks (&gt;512 GiB) became more mainstream,<br>
the OS/2 Boot Manager was not capable of correctly handling them.<br>
After some investigation, it became clear that AirBoot would be a very<br>
suitable candidate to replace the aging OS/2 Boot Manager,<br>
but a few things needed to be fixed first.<br>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>
Martin however, had moved on to other projects and was not<br>
developing AirBoot anymore, but he kindly gave his permission to modify<br>
AirBoot in any way required such that it could replace the OS/2 Boot Manager.<br>
With the release of eComStation v2.1 (2011), AirBoot was ready to replace<br>
the OS/2 Boot Manager and so it was included in that release.<br>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>
It is safe to say that AirBoot saved the day at a time when<br>
huge harddisks came along and the fight for primary partitions got worse.<br>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>
<span style="font-weight:bold">Thank you Martin !</span><br>
</p>

<h3>Some AirBoot Highlights</h3>
<h4>No Primary Partition Required</h4>
<p class="widget-description">
Because AirBoot is written in (neat and compact) Assembler,<br>
it is small enough to fit in the track0 (nowhereland) space.<br>
So, unlike OS/2 Boot Manager, AirBoot does not require a primary partition,<br>
resolving the problem that occured with Windows 7 OEM installations.<br>
And since OS/2 has had long time capability of booting from logical partitions,<br>
it could completely leave the dogfight for primaries.<br>
</p>
<h4>On The Fly Partition Scanning</h4>
<p class="widget-description">
When AirBoot starts it scans all partitions<br>
on all disks and enumerates them in a list which is then presented.<br>
Whenever partitions are added or removed,<br>
at the next boot AirBoot presents these changes immediately.<br>
</p>
<h4>Built-in Setup</h4>
<p class="widget-description">
AirBoot contains a Setup mode which allows<br>
configuration directly from within AirBoot itself.<br>
No other tools required.<br>
</p>
<h4>Support For Huge Harddisks</h4>
<p class="widget-description">
Under OS/2, huge harddisks are handled by using a special geometry.<br>
AirBoot understands this special geometry, allowing OS/2 to boot from<br>
partitions located above the 512 GiB boundary.<br>
</p>
<h4>Operating System Agnostic</h4>
<p class="widget-description">
While the major focus of AirBoot is booting OS/2,<br>
it has always been capable of booting other operating-systems.<br>
It supports booting many versions of Windows and booting Linux is<br>
done by chainloading GRUB.<br>
</p>

<h3>Before Using AirBoot</h3>
<p>
Before installing AirBoot,<br>
it would be a good idea to learn a little bit more about it.<br>
This is especially true with regard to partitioning harddisks the way<br>
OS/2 likes it (use its volume manager) and the co-existance<br>
with other operating-systems.<br>
</p>

Builds of this special branch<br>
will appear here in the near future and their installation<br>
will not interfere with stock Odin.<br>

<h3>Developer Notes</h3>
<p>
This project is *not* a fork of the original Netlabs project.<br>
It is a *clone* done with <code>git-svn</code> with the purpose to be able<br>
to use Git Branching for testing and feature additions.<br>
The bi-directional mapping is:<br>
<code>github:project~master</code> &lt;-&gt; <code>netlabs:project~branches/swt</code>
</p>

<h3>Reporting Problems</h3>
<p>
The preferred way is through Netlabs Track,<br>
and you can create a new ticket using the following link:<br>
<a href="http://trac.netlabs.org/odin32/newticket" class="code.no">Report a problem on Netlabs Trac</a><br>
(note: you need to be logged-in to netlabs to create a ticket)<br>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>
But, before you report a new problem,<br>
please check if the problem you are about to report<br>
was not already reported by somebody else:<br>
<a href="http://trac.netlabs.org/odin32/report" class="code.no">View existing problem reports on Netlabs Trac</a><br>
